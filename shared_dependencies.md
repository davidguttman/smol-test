1. Dependencies: Both the server-side and client-side code share dependencies on Node.js, Express, and React. The server-side code uses Express for routing and middleware, while the client-side code uses React for building the user interface.

2. Exported Variables: The server-side code exports the Express app from "app.js", and the router from "server/routes/api.js". The client-side code exports the main App component from "client/src/App.js", and individual components from their respective files.

3. Data Schemas: The "server/models/ScrapedData.js" file defines a schema for the scraped data that is stored in the database. This schema is used by the server-side code to interact with the database.

4. DOM Element IDs: The client-side code uses DOM element IDs to interact with specific elements in the user interface. These IDs include "urlInput" for the URL input field, "aboutPage" for the about page, "scrapedPage" for the page displaying the scraped data, and "sharePage" for the page with the shareable copy.

5. Message Names: The server-side code uses message names to communicate with the client-side code. These include "scrapeUrl" for the message to scrape a URL, and "storeData" for the message to store the scraped data.

6. Function Names: The server-side code uses function names to define its behavior. These include "scrapeUrl" for the function to scrape a URL, and "storeData" for the function to store the scraped data. The client-side code uses function names to define its behavior, including "handleUrlInput" for the function to handle URL input, and "displayScrapedData" for the function to display the scraped data.
